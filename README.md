# face recognition using haarcascades and svm.
This is a machine learning project. I have used openCV haarcascades to detect face and eyes. I have trained the dataset on a SVM, getting a best score of 0.8108108108108109.
I have created a python flask server to host the model.
It can recognize any of the following sports celebrities - Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Virat Kohli.
Currently, there is no UI.
